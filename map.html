            <h1>LOCATION & DIRECTIONS</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Hotel Excelsior!

                Whether you are arriving from near or far – your journey to us will be easy and simple 
                thanks to our location directly at Munich central station. When arriving by train it will 
                take you less than 5 minutes to walk from the platform to our hotel. Check in and start 
                exploring Munich city. The city center and all the important sights are just a stone’s throw 
                away.
                
            </p>

            <h2>CENTRAL LOCATION DIRECTLY AT MUNICH CENTRAL STATION</h2>
            <p>Hotel Excelsior is located in the pedestrian area between central station and ‚Karlsplatz‘. 
                The proximity to many of Munich’s attractions makes it a perfect hotel for enthusiastic city 
                tourists. In only 15 minutes you will reach Marienplatz via the shopping street ‚
                Kaufingerstrasse‘. From there it is only a short hop to ‚Viktualienmarkt‘, the famous Munich 
                farmer’s market. Also only 15 minutes away from Hotel Excelsior, is the ‚Sendlinger Tor‘ and 
                the bustling precinct ‚Glockenbachviertel‘. Here you can find many restaurant, bars and 
                nightclubs. When you decide to move in the northerly direction, you will reach ‚Königsplatz‘, 
                and the art district with all its museums and art galleries in less than 10 minutes. With 
                taking only a few steps, you can enjoy Munich’s history and culture first-hand.

            </p>

            <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
            <p>A dream for every city tourist: The centrally located Hotel Excelsior at Munich central station 
                is not only surrounded by famous landmarks and historic places, it is also very easy to reach. 
                Four subway lines, all suburban trains, and many bus and tramlines are in close proximity to 
                Hotel Excelsior. Thus, the outskirts of Munich are also reached in no time. Both, the Olympic 
                Park in the north, and the Hellabrunn Zoo in the south are less than 20 minutes away. To get 
                to the airport, you either take the suburban train S1 or S8 – from the hotel to the check-in 
                counter you will need less than an hour.
            
            </p>

            <h2>HOTEL SERVICE AT ITS BEST</h2>
            <p>If your flight leaves late in the evening, you are more than welcome to spend your waiting time 
                at our lobby. Here you can make use of the free WiFi and enjoy the historic Bavarian atmosphere. 
                Your flight leaves early in the morning, and you do not want to travel empty-stomached? Not a problem, 
                we will prepare an early bird breakfast for you if you let us know the day before. To load and unload 
                your luggage, you can stop directly in front of Hotel Excelsior at any time. After that, you can park 
                your car in one of the public car parks in the immediate vicinity. Our recommendation is Elisenhof parking 
                garage (Luitpoldstr. 3, 80335 Munich). If there is anything else you might need while staying with us, 
                our concierge will be more than happy to fulfill every wish.
